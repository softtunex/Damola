              I was responsible for conducting the UX research, designing
              wireframes, prototypes, usability testing, and making iterations
              based on the data collected and synthesizing user goals with
              business goals.

            <p>
              I had a brief session with the client to understand the business
              goals, then I used the design thinking process to uncover the user
              needs while accounting for business goals.

          To get started on this UI, I built a design system to maintain
          consistency in line with the brand guideline. This helped me to easily
          make iterations on the whole mockup. Below are some screens from the
          design;

            To capture testers' attention, I placed core features in the hero
