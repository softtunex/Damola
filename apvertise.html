            I was hired as a Product designer by Apvertise in November 2022 to
            come solve a particular problem - Customer churn. Apvertise is an
            influencer marketing platform that opens up a modern way of
            advertisement, empowering businesses and individuals in every
            industry to boost their brand growth.

              I led the research efforts on this project, and collaborated with
              other designers on the team. During the preliminary research and
              execution stages, I confirmed buy-in from higher stakeholders and
              product managers via regular meetings. The project required close
              collaboration and communication with marketing manager, content
              strategists and developers to understand the current state of the
              product.

        <p class="word-resp">
          Having identified the surface problem to be customer churn, it was
          important to carry out a research to understand why customers were
          churning. I took a thorough look at the web application to draw
          hypothesis, as well as spoke to the marketing manager and developers
          to review the existing data in order to identify the patterns in user
          behaviours.

            <p>
              For an influencer marketing platform where business owners expects
              to get value by getting sales/visibility, they need to be able
              find influencers that will get their product/service to their last
              mile customer.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              However, this was not the case as there was no way to identify the
              influencers being onboarded except through the basic details
              displayed.

              There was no way for business owners who launch campaigns to

              was growing nor regressing.

              Having identified the two problem, I had a focus interview with
              the existing customers virtually to validate these hypothesis and
              garner more insights on what may have been missed out. After the
              first inteview, I quickly designed a the first draft of the
              screens and conducted a usability test.
