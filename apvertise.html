            I was hired as a Product designer by Apvertise in November 2022 to
            come solve a particular problem - Customer churn. Apvertise is an
            influencer marketing platform that opens up a modern way of
            advertisement, empowering businesses and individuals in every
            industry to boost their brand growth.

            <p>
              I led the research efforts on this project, and collaborated with
              other designers on the team. During the preliminary research and
              execution stages, I confirmed buy-in from higher stakeholders and
              product managers via regular meetings. The project required close
              collaboration and communication with marketing manager, content
              strategists and developers to understand the current state of the
              product.

        <h1 class="apvertise-sub-h">The Challenge</h1>
        <p>
          Having identified the surface problem to be customer churn, it was
          important to carry out a research to understand why customers were
          churning. I took a thorough look at the web application to draw
          hypothesis, as well as spoke to the marketing manager and developers
          to review the existing data in order to identify the patterns in user
          behaviours.

        <p>
          For an influencer marketing platform where business owners expects to
          get value by getting sales/visibility, they need to be able find
          influencers that will get their product/service to their last mile
          customer. <br />
          However, this was not the case as there was no way to identify the
          influencers being onboarded except through the basic details
          displayed.

          I fleshed out wireframes to synthesize the business goals & user needs

          I proceeded to mid-fidelity prototype to visualize the content

        <h1 class="apvertise-sub-h">High Fidelity Design</h1>
        <p>
          To get started on this UI, I built a design system to maintain
          consistency in line with the brand guideline. This helped me to easily
          make iterations on the whole mockup. Below are some screens from the
          design;

          High Fidelity Prototype was tested by asking 9 participants to perform
          2 tasks and respond to 2 follow-up questions on Maze.

          Although, there were no major usability issues but I noticed that the

            To capture testers' attention, I placed core features in the hero

            animations effectively grab and retain attention.

          To help save time in decision-making, I highlighted the benefits of
          each plans in different cards and placed more emphasis on the plan
          that would enable them to access multiple cards and by so doing help
          the business achieve its goal of generating revenue

          Working on this project reinforced my belief in the importance of
          conducting research and usability testing.

          The research helped me in structuring the design according to the UK
